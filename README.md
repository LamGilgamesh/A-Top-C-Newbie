Here collects some stuffs I need for C language learning.

2019.11.6 1st update ever
  Hi everyone, I am RozenWhite.
  Today I open my GitHub, I am so excited to walk into this beautiful community.
  I am a 19 years old boy, I am from China and studying in Xiamen University Malaysia now, and I am in my second year of the degree.
  My major is Computer Science and Technology, doing research in audition field is my dream.
  Because I've learned playing the violin since 7, and I also make some hiphop music now, so I call myself a musician.
  If you are a Chinese too, maybe you know a music platform called NetEase Cloud Music, my art name is 洛神白 which you can search on it.
  My English is not good, but I am learning very hard, this is also why all of these words reads like written by a 3 years old baby haha.
  This is my first inventory, it is about C programming language. 
  I will share some programs I have done, whatever they are easy or complicated, all I want is to record my every step in this road.
  Hope I could be a good programmer and developer, and I hope that day could come as soon as possible.
  If fortunately, you read till here, which is my great honor, I am so happy and grateful if you give me any suggestion and feedbacks.
  Thank you~~ ^_^
